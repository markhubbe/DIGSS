Description: Simulation tool to estimate the rate of success that surveys possessing user-specific characteristics have in identifying archaeological sites (or any groups of clouds of objects), given specific parameters of survey area, survey methods, and site properties. The survey approach used is largely based on the work of Kintigh (1988) <doi:10.2307/281113>.
