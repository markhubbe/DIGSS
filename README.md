DIGSS is a simulation tool to estimate the rate of success that surveys possessing user-specific characteristics have 
in identifying archaeological sites (or any groups of clouds of objects), given specific parameters of survey area, 
survey methods, and site properties.

A detailed description of application of the package to archaeology can be found in:
